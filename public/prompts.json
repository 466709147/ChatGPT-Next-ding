      "Generate a bilingual CN-EN terminology list from the Claims of a patent application in Chinese. Please note the purpose of the list is to keep consistent term usage throughout an English translation of the application, so pay special attention to the frequently used feature names, actions, module names, etc... When encountering ambiguous terms, please make educated guesses based on the most probable technical meaning and note any uncertainties at the end. You are presenting the terms in lowercase English, without Pinyin. Please ensure clarity and precision in the translation process and provide a one-to-one mapping without explanations. Here is the Claims for you to extract the terms from:"

      "Thanks. Can you translate the Claims section while sticking to these terms and respecting the format of the original text including each line break? Please note the one-uppercase rule for each claim, where each claim begins with a capitalized letter and runs to the end with no other capitals and with only one full stop at the end. Please use 'comprise' and its variants rather than 'include' and its variants."

      "Translate the rest of the document, i.e, the whole Specification and the Abstract, following the terms and the phrasing of the claims. Here are some rules to follow:
1. The same translation should be used for identical source text, with the exception of format and style differences between the Claims and Specification sections: In the Specification, please use "include" instead of 'comprise' and 'where' instead of 'wherein'. 
2. Translate '第x方面，提供了...' as 'According to a xx-th aspect, ... is provided'. 
3. Translate '图1' as 'FIG. 1' (in uppercase).
4. Proceed with the translation to the best of your length limit. If you cannot output the complete translation in one response, you can just leave it off and I will signal you to continue in the next response. 
5. Keep the paragraph numbers in the translated text.
6. Strictly translate acronyms and abbreviations as they appear in the source text. For example, '无线资源控制RRC信令' should be translated as 'radio resource control RRC signaling', and '带宽部分（Bandwidth Part，BWP）' should be translated as 'bandwidth part (Bandwidth Part, BWP)'.
Here is the text to be translated:"
